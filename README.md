## 🔬 Introduction
This is the official PyTorch implementation of PriFold, a deep-learning-based RNA secondary structure prediction method.

Predicting RNA secondary structures is crucial for understanding RNA function, designing RNA-based therapeutics, and studying molecular interactions within cells. Existing deep-learning-based methods for RNA secondary structure prediction have mainly focused on local structural properties, often overlooking the global characteristics and evolutionary features of RNA sequences.

Guided by biological priors, we propose PriFold, incorporating two key innovations:
1. Improving attention mechanism with pairing probabilities to utilize global pairing characteristics
2. Implementing data augmentation based on RNA covariation to leverage evolutionary information

Our structured enhanced pretraining and finetuning strategy significantly optimizes model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PriFold achieves state-of-the-art results in RNA secondary structure prediction on benchmark datasets such as bpRNA, RNAStrAlign and ArchiveII.
